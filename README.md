or any kaggle dateset is legit, important thing is keep the right dimentions.

## Usage
There are some pretrained models that are available and stored.
Program should run in any machine if environment is valid, no GPU or CPU cpecifications are needed.
Please, note that all directory paths are in default "path". Make sure setting them 
before running the program.
